# gridiron-js
mostly so I can learn web development but would be nice if this became real

# test it out [here](https://elijah9.github.io/gridiron-js/html/index.html)

# the vision as of this commit
* a 2D football CPU vs CPU simulator (NFL ruleset)
* tech stack: HTML5, JavaScript
* vector based sprites/tiles? (Paper.js?)

# to do list
* look at tutorials for 2D browser games ([my current inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-OKdSHRlfA))
* start copying over C# classes, switching from MVVM to MVC - shouldn't be too hard since most of the code is models
