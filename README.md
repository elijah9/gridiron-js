# gridiron-js
mostly so I can learn web development but would be nice if this became real

# test it out [here](https://elijah9.github.io/gridiron-js/html/index.html)

# the vision as of this commit
* a 2D football CPU vs CPU simulator (NFL ruleset)
* tech stack: HTML5, TypeScript, JavaScript
* vector based graphics using Paper.js

# to do list
* the addition of an external library broke the Github portal, fix that because it means it doesn't work as a web app!!!
* * I think the problem is I put the build directory in the gitignore, which is normally good but not if you want the repo to double as the platform
* start copying over C# classes, switching from MVVM to MVC - shouldn't be too hard since most of the code is models

# shelved tasks
* figure out why coloring the jersey isn't working (switched to circle representation of players for now)
