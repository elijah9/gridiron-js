* basic framework for game logic in place

# the vision as of this commit
* a 2D football CPU vs CPU simulator (NFL ruleset)
* Angular/TypeScript
* vector based graphics using Svg.JS

# to do list
* game event log for play outcome
* run block mechanic
* make real (but still basic) 11 on 11 plays
* get app working via Github.io again

# bugs to fix
